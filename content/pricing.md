  - question: What plan should I choose?
    answer: It depends on the number of websites you manage and the number of Amazon
      affiliate links you need to check. Let’s say you are promoting 100 Amazon products
      on your website, and you want to check them every 3 days. The Personal plan
      will be just fine!
  - question: How often are my links checked?
    answer: There is no automatic links' scans and checks as we don’t want to use
      your link quota unnecessarily. Scans could be launched manually, clicking on
      the “New Scan” button on the top right of your dashboard.
  - question: What is a “link”?
    answer: In our pricing plan, a “link” refers to a unique Amazon product link.
      If you have identical links for the same product on multiple page, we will deduct
      only one link from your link quota.
  - question: Is there any requirements to use the service?
    answer: Yes! In order to use our tool, you will be required to provide your official
      Amazon Product Advertising API Key. Please check in your Amazon Affiliate Account
      to ensure that you are able to create API keys, before you buy any ClickClickBankBank
      Plan.
  - question: What is your refund/cancellation policy?
    answer: Refund are for available for 7 days after signup, or anytime if you did
      not start any scan in your account. Note that you can change or cancel your
      plan at any moment within your Plan & Billing section.
  - question: Do you offer support if I need help?
    answer: Yes! Top-notch customer support is key for a quality product, so we’ll
      do our very best to resolve any issues you encounter communicating via our Support
      Platform.
